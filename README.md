Fissure

A 46-key split keyboard that combines the ideas of [5plit](https://oddrocketkeyboards.blogspot.com/2018/05/5plit-v2.html) and [for science](https://github.com/peej/for-science-keyboard).

Only firmware is currently available, as I lost my design files when I accidentally deleted them. I will remake them if I have the time to do so.

My keymap is also available [here](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/99409a249d886554bd60af15782b2d50). It's still incomplete, and some keys that might be important (like del) but aren't affecting me a lot are missing. I'm probably going to tweak my keymap sometime later.
