Fissure
=======

A 36/46-key split keyboard that combined (in version 1) the ideas of
[5plit](https://oddrocketkeyboards.blogspot.com/2018/05/5plit-v2.html) and [for science](https://github.com/peej/for-science-keyboard). The current design is version 2.1. You can find keymaps and gerber files for both versions if you want to build your own (I'm not used to version controlling PCB files, so if you have problems with them, please let me know). The firmware of this keyboard is based on [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).  The PCB files are in `pcb/`, and firmwares in `qmk/`.

# Version 2

The gerber files for version 2 is in a separate folder (I still need to get used to version control with external-software-managed files), and there's a new version undergoing design.

# Version 1

Only firmware and gerber files are currently available, as I lost my design files when I accidentally deleted them (and I used no VCS at that time :)).
