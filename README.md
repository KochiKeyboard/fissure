A 36/46-key split keyboard that combined the ideas of [5plit](https://oddrocketkeyboards.blogspot.com/2018/05/5plit-v2.html) and [for science](https://github.com/peej/for-science-keyboard).

I got interested in (weird/uncommon) keyboard designs in 11th grade, when I saw one of my friends using his tablet with a keyboard cover and tapping the keys while the keyboard is folded back under the tablet. I thought he was actually using the keyboard, and I came up with the idea of a back-typing keyboard. I have thought about making functional back-typing keyboards and one-handed keyboards, but I never made a usable prototype. Later, I discovered the Mechanical Keyboards subReddit, and I decided that I want to make this keyboard.

I settled on the 46 key layout to give myself a bit more flexibility to change between different layouts, and I used a orthogonal layout as I felt it was a more standard layout so it should be easier for me to get used to.

Only firmware is currently available, as I lost my design files when I accidentally deleted them. I will remake them if I have the time to do so.

My keymap is also available [here](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/99409a249d886554bd60af15782b2d50). It's still incomplete, and some keys that might be important (like del) but aren't affecting me a lot are missing. I'm probably going to tweak my keymap sometime later.
